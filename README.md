# Description
This project was part of my coursework during my Master's at Queen Mary University of London. The project showcases the Engine Architecture, Efficient C++, and Game programming Patterns inspired by Design Patterns. Multiple Architectures like Entity, Components and Entity Component System Architectures were explored and the latest update includes the Entity Component System Architecture. Game programming patterns like flyweight, Observer, Command, Singleton, Component, and Service Locator have been implemented. The adaptive Game loop has been chosen and FPS is set at 60fps. Entity Component System Architecture is implemented using the ByteCode and Object Pool patterns. Further Behaviour Tree expansion for the project is being reviewed to make NPCs and enemies in the Game.

# Status
The project is currently under development. The Core code for Graphics, Game objects, Player, Input, Collision, and Sound has been implemented. Enemies module is yet to be implemented based on Behaviour Tree and Utility-based Agents.

# Setup
To build the project you need SFML 2.5.1 binaries. The SFML library has to be statically linked with all the libraries included in the linker. 
The assets have all been included in the project directory.
